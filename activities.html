                Join thousands of students, coaches, and hosts in TEAMS (Tests
                of Engineering Aptitude, Mathematics, and Science)—an annual,
                theme-based competition that provides middle school and high
                school students with the opportunity to discover engineering
                with the potential to make a difference in the world. Every
                year, students, coaches, and hosts across the country experience
                TEAMS.

                TEAMS is an annual competition designed to help middle school
                and high school students discover their STEM potential. Teams of
                two to four students apply their knowledge in practical,
                creative ways to solve real-world engineering challenges.

                model or prototype), and an effective multimedia presentation.

                The annual design challenge for the 2021 National TSA Conference
                is unchanged from the 2020 National TSA Conference due to the
                broadness of the topic. Student members may not use an entry
                that has already been submitted. The design challenge is to
                identify a need in a developing country, and design a project
                that will enable that community to fulfill that need (for ideas,
                check out: Engineers Without Borders and other similar
                organizations that are helping people build better, safer
                communities).

                luxury.<br /><br />Sub Topic 1: The government should prioritize
                improving or initiating internet connections in rural areas.<br /><br />
                Topic 2: School districts must provide hotspots to all
                students.<br /><br />Topic 3: Small businesses must receive

                Theme of 2020-2021 year: Medical On Demand<br /><br />Context:
                Due to recent global events, consumers and the healthcare
                industry were forced to change their medical screening
                practices. Virtual appointments via mobile interfacing and
                webcam communications have been used for patients that were
                unable to or restricted from physically seeing a doctor.<br /><br />Challenge:
                Create a fictional medical telecommunications company and design
                a website. The website should serve as a guide for information
                about the company and their communication services provided.
                Present an overview of services as if you were a consumer.
                Provide the type of solutions your company creates, sells,
                and/or serves. Sections of the site may include photos, product
                descriptions, renderings, company history, contact, and news
                updates.
